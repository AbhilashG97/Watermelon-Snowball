# Notes on Paper

This section contains notes on some of the papers I have read. I have used the three-pass method for reading these papers as described [here](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf).

:warning: The notes will contain only those things which I found important while reading the papers.
